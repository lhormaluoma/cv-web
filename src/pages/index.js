        <p>You're currently looking at a website project of mine. This project started while thinking of applying for summer jobs for 2022 to get something concrete to present to possible employers. My main aim was to produce something that resembled a CV, could host an online visual portfolio, and still have room for improvement</p>
        <p>I chose a static website generator called Gatsby to begin my project and it's being hosted by Gatsby's own Gatsby Cloud service. This was started with <Link to = "">gatsby-default-starter</Link> and upgraded with various plugins. I'm constantly trying to improve my abilities concerning gatsby and I hope this website will look different when you see it the next time</p>

        <h6><Link to = "https://as.fi/">as.fi</Link></h6>
        <p>I volunteered as my university guild's Head of Communications, which also gave me the responsibility over the <Link to = "https://as.fi/">as.fi</Link> website. The Jekyll based platform taught me the basics of web development with navigating and updating html, markdown and markup files. My predecessor also taught me good practices with git based projects and working in a multi-developer environment.</p>

        <h5>Visual Creation</h5>
        <p>I've always been a visual person and my hobbies definitely reflect it. I've taken a liking especially to photography, which I've been doing for the past five years. I can consider myself proficient with Adobe's creative tool arsenal. I use Lightroom and Photoshop almost daily and have also done multiple projects on Illustrator, InDesign and Premiere Pro</p>
        <p>My visual skills have gotten me volunteering positions concerning communications in five different organisations, mostly around my studies, but also including a professional environment during my mandatory service in the Finnish military.</p>
