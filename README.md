## Hey!

This is my personal website project I started while applying for jobs in 2022.

It functions as a CV, Portfolio and a contact form.

## How to run (development build)

Make sure your git, npm and Node.js are up to date

Install gatsby-cli globally (you may need root privileges), if you haven't already.

```
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```

Clone this repository and change into the directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/leevihormaluoma/cv-web

cd cv-web
```

Install dependencies with

```
npm i
```

Run development build and start temporary Web server by running

```
gatsby develop
```

The website is now accessible at http://localhost:8000.
